/**
 * Problem
 * Nightking wants to attack the kingdom and he really likes cold days.
 * However, he doesnâ€™t want to attack the kingdom on the coldest day, because it is obvious.
 *
 * Instead, he will attack the second coldest day. Given an array
 * A of N distinct integers where Ai represents the temperature forecast of the
 * i-th day, You need to find the temperature of the day of the attack.
 *
 * Input Format
 * First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
 * Each test case contains two lines of input.
 * The first line of every test case contains an integer
 * N - the number of days
 * The second line of every test case contains N integers - A1, A2,..,AN
 * denoting the temperature forecast of the i-th day.
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, output in a single line - the answer to the i-th test case.
